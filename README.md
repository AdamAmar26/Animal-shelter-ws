# Pet Adoption Center Project

## Project 1: Animal Shelter

### Adam Amar - October 2024

### Part 1 - Design Documentation

The **Pet Adoption Center** project is designed to support a local pet shelter in its mission to connect adoptable pets with loving homes. We are building a user-friendly website that simplifies the adoption process, allowing users to:

- View pets available for adoption
- Check the steps needed to adopt
- Submit their applications online

### Problem & Solution

Many existing pet adoption websites suffer from poor navigation, outdated designs, and unclear information, making it difficult for potential adopters to find the information they need. This project aims to solve these problems by creating a **modern, intuitive site** that acts as a comprehensive resource for users interested in adopting pets.

Our goal is to make the website:

- **Visually appealing**: Attractive design that encourages engagement.
- **Easy to navigate**: Simple user interface to improve discoverability.
- **Informative**: Detailed information on pets and the adoption process.

By accomplishing this, we hope to increase the number of successful adoptions and help reduce the shelterâ€™s workload. Ultimately, this website will act as a **bridge between the shelter and the community**, helping pets find homes and people find companions.
